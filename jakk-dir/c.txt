Allow me to introduce myself
My name is Tay
It's T-A-Y, T-A-Y to the Z
This is the web and it's gonna murder your TV

It was Chocolate Rain
Wrote a song about that history
Chocolate Rain
Now I'm paid a hefty hefty fee

Chocolate Rain
Listen to the funky rhymes I weave
Chocolate Rain
I move away from the mic to breathe

He moves his mouth away from the mic so he can breathe [Repeat]

I wanna tell you about a love that took me by force

She took my heart like a wild read horse. I call her

Cherry Chocolate Rain
I open the door and see you standing there
Cherry Chocolate Rain
Pull me in with that delicious stare

Cherry Chocolate Rain
I need you right now don't you want to stay
Cherry Chocolate Rain
Your beauty burns me like a solar ray

Mista Johnson with Tay Zonday
Most downloaded video clips
Most exclusive video chicks
Makin big videos
With big city pros
Got mad pad willy flows
That get many dough oh

Make it pop cherry
Whoa, tick tock to the clock
little Berry flows
Ridiculous, Mista Johnson
and Tay Zonday sick with this

Cherry Chocolate Rain
Release my love and unlock the chains
Cherry Chocolate Rain
Your energy is coarsing through my veins

Cherry Chocolate Rain
Ohio's agricultuer's based on grains
Cherry Chocolate Rain
My love will just never be the same

Dark sweet unexpected
Taste the secret you're infected
Cure my body's deepest pains
Brought the thunder, made it rain

Oh, my Cherry Chocolate Rain.
I love you.
This internet thing is wild
