1.  Background

   Since nearly the discovery of the dark-skinned Negroid race [Negro],
   the white man has found this race to be incalculably useful in many
   commercial endeavors from cotton picking to producing "hip" and
   "urban" music.  It has come to the attention of the Authors that the
   time may be ripe to introduce a viable new system of transmitting
   Internet Protocol Datagrams using this hardy and industrious race of
   dark-skinned commodity.

2.  Frame Encoding and Transmission

   Sending a Datagram using a Negro is a complicated business, and it
   may place considerable strain on systems not accustomed to dealing
   with large amounts of Negroes, particularly at institutions of higher
   education, polite society and Libraries.  There are multiple steps
   which must be taken to encode and prepare the Datagram for
   transmission, which are as follows.

2.1.  Encryption and Encapsulation

   Firstly, to prepare the IP Datagram for transmission, it must be
   encoded so as to provide end-to-end encryption of the contents of the
   data.  To encode the datagram, simply have it bound into a story-
   book.  This simple transformation will leave the Negro clueless as to
   its contents, and it will be disinclined to scan its pages as Negroes
   have a well-known natural dislike for books.  While the authors
   acknowledge that the book-binding time increases the latency of
   transmission, they contend that it is necessary to provide the
   highest level of security and it necessary to fully utilize all
   aspects of the Negroid, much as the Red-man once utilized all the
   parts of the Buffalo and White man.

2.2.  Ready to Send

   Once the bound volume is produced, a Negro must be found to entrust
   with the volume.  There are many ways of attracting Negroes, some
   common mechanisms are: announcing that "welfare checks" are ready,
   purveying crack cocaine, playing "hip" and "urban music" or laying
   out fried chicken.  Once you have attracted the Negroes attention,
   promise him a fortified wine if he simply delivers the volume to the
   desired location.

2.3.  Transmission

   Once the Negro has been entrusted with the volume containing the
   Datagram, it must be sent on its with, ideally with a watermelon to
   fortify its strength.  It may be noted that the transmission time can
   vary greatly due to variables intrinsic to the Negro such as loose
   pants inhibiting movement, drunkenness, crack cocaine, parole
   officers or parenthood.

   Simply point the Negro in the direction you wish it to travel, inform
   it that its destination is the nearest welfare office, hand it a
   watermelon for optimization and send it on its way.

2.4.  Decoding

   To decode the Datagram, simple remove the book from the Negro and
   transfer the contents of its pages into the computer by whatever
   means deemed advisable.

3.  Technical Notes

3.1.  TTL

   A generally reasonable TTL value for the Negro is approx. 30 years,
   give or take a few due to a number of factors such as propensity
   towards menthol cigarettes, crack cocaine consumption and gang
   affiliations.

3.2.  NAT Traversal

   One advantage of using the Negro as a physical-link layer is that it
   contains built-in support for NAT traversal for higher-level layer
   protocols.  As is well-known, the Negro has a natural talent for
   criminal sub-human acts such as breaking and entering, which is a
   useful option that can be set with the JUVIE flag.  This will enable
   the Negro to bypass whatever routing mechanisms may be in place and
   deliver the Datagram to its destination no matter what NAT is in
   place.

4.  Security Considerations

   It is worth noting that the Negro's baser instincts can overwhelm it
   at times, provoking erratic behavior that can lead to a loss of data.
   Some examples of this would be selling the book to pay for its baby's
   momma's garments, burning the volume for warmth or trying to smoke
   the volume.  If there is an error in transmission the process must be
   repeated.  Errors in transmission are easy to detect because the
   Negro will invariably arrive at what it believes the welfare center,
   and it will become quite obvious that the volume was lost in
   transmission.  The downside is that the Negro may forego appearing at
   the destination until the first of the month, creating a possible
   latency of up to a month.

   Also consideration should be given to what is called the "Negro-in-
   the-middle" attack.  This may be avoided using techniques described
   in RFC3069 ("A Description of Negro Error Correction - The Prison
   System").
