(either an individual or a single entity) and Microsoft
Corporation for the Microsoft software product identified above,
which includes computer software and may include associated
media, printed materials, "online" or electronic documentation,
and Internet-based services ("Product").    An amendment or
addendum to this EULA may accompany the Product.  YOU AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS EULA BY
INSTALLING, COPYING, OR OTHERWISE USING THE
PRODUCT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT INSTALL
OR USE THE PRODUCT; YOU MAY RETURN IT TO YOUR
PLACE OF PURCHASE FOR A FULL REFUND.
 
 1. GRANT OF LICENSE. Microsoft grants you the following rights
    provided that you comply with all terms and conditions of
    this EULA:
 
    * Installation and use.  You may install, use, access,
      display and run one copy of the Product on a single
      computer, such as a workstation, terminal or other device
      ("Workstation Computer").  The Product may not be used
      by more than two (2) processors at  any one time on any
      single Workstation Computer. You may permit a maximum
      of ten (10) computers or other electronic devices (each
      a "Device") to connect to the Workstation Computer to
      utilize the services of the Product solely for File and
      Print services, Internet Information Services, and remote
      access (including connection sharing and telephony
      services).  The ten connection maximum includes any
      indirect connections made through "multiplexing" or other
      software or hardware which pools or aggregates
      connections.  Except as otherwise permitted by the
      NetMeeting, Remote Assistance, and Remote Desktop
      features described below, you may not use the Product
      to permit any Device to use, access, display or run other
      executable software residing on the Workstation Computer,
      nor may you permit any Device to use, access, display,
      or run the Product or Product's user interface, unless
      the Device has a separate license for the Product.  
 
    * Mandatory Activation. The license rights granted under this
      EULA are limited to the first thirty (30) days after
      you first install  the Product unless you supply
      information required to activate your licensed copy in
      the manner described during the setup sequence of the
      Product.  You can activate the Product through the use
      of the Internet or telephone; toll charges may apply.
      You may also need to reactivate the Product if you modify
      your computer hardware or alter the Product.  There are
      technological measures in this Product that are designed
      to prevent unlicensed or illegal use of the Product. 
      You agree that we may use those measures.
 
    * Storage/Network Use. You may also store or install a copy
      of the Product on a storage device, such as a network
      server, used only to install or run the Product on your
      other Workstation Computers over an internal network;
      however, you must acquire and dedicate an additional
      license for each separate Workstation Computer on or
      from which the Product is installed, used, accessed,
      displayed or run. A license for the Product may not be
      shared or used concurrently on different Workstation
      Computers.
 
    * Reservation of Rights. Microsoft reserves all rights not
      expressly granted to you in this EULA.
 
 2. UPGRADES. To use a Product identified as an upgrade, you must
    first be licensed for the product identified by Microsoft
    as eligible for the upgrade. After upgrading, you may no
    longer use the product that formed the basis for your
    upgrade eligibility.
 
 3. ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE/SERVICES.  This EULA
    applies to updates, supplements, add-on components,
    or Internet-based services components, of the Product that
    Microsoft may provide to you or make available to you after
    the date you obtain your initial copy of the Product,
    unless we provide other terms along with the update,
    supplement, add-on component, or Internet-based services
    component.  Microsoft reserves the right to discontinue any
    Internet-based services provided to you or made available
    to you through the use of the Product.  This EULA does not
    grant you any rights to use the Windows Media Format
    Software Development Kit ("WMFSDK") components contained
    in the Product to develop a software application that uses
    Windows Media technology.  If you wish to use the WMFSDK
    to develop such an application, visit
    http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/imedia/windowsmedia/sdk/wmsdk.asp,
    accept a separate license for the WMFSDK, download the
    appropriate WMFSDK, and install it on your system. 
 
 4. TRANSFER-Internal.  You may move the Product to a different
    Workstation Computer.  After the transfer, you must
    completely remove the Product from the former Workstation
    Computer.  Transfer to Third Party. The initial user of the
    Product may make a one-time transfer of the Product to
    another end user.  The transfer has to include all
    component parts, media, printed materials, this EULA, and
    if applicable, the Certificate of Authenticity.  The
    transfer may not be an indirect transfer, such as a
    consignment.  Prior to the transfer, the end user receiving
    the transferred Product must agree to all the EULA terms.
    No Rental.  You may not rent, lease, lend or provide
    commercial hosting services to third parties with the
    Product.
 
 5. LIMITATION ON REVERSE ENGINEERING,
    DECOMPILATION, AND DISASSEMBLY. You may
    not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the
    Product, except and only to the extent that it is expressly
    permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this
    limitation. 
 
 6. TERMINATION. Without prejudice to any other rights, Microsoft
    may cancel this EULA if you do not abide by the terms and
    conditions of this EULA, in which case you must destroy all
    copies of the Product and all of its component parts.
 
 7. DESCRIPTION OF OTHER RIGHTS AND
    LIMITATIONS. 
 
    * NetMeeting/Remote Assistance/Remote Desktop Features.  The
      Product contains NetMeeting, Remote Assistance, and
      Remote Desktop technologies that enable the Product or
      other applications installed on the Workstation Computer
      to be used remotely between two or more computers, even
      if the Product or application is installed on only one
      Workstation Computer.  You may use NetMeeting, Remote
      Assistance, and Remote Desktop with all Microsoft products;
      provided however, use of these technologies with
      certain Microsoft products may require an additional
      license.  For Microsoft and non-Microsoft products, you
      should consult the license agreement accompanying the
      applicable product or contact the applicable licensor
      to determine whether use of NetMeeting, Remote
      Assistance, or Remote Desktop is permitted without an
      additional license.
 
    * Consent to Use of Data.  You agree that Microsoft and its
      affiliates may collect and use technical information
      gathered in any manner as part of the product support
      services provided to you, if any, related to the Product.
      Microsoft may use this information solely to improve
      our products or to provide customized services or
      technologies to you.  Microsoft may disclose this
      information to others, but not in a form that personally
      identifies you.  
 
    * Internet Gaming/Update Features.  If you choose to utilize
      the Internet gaming or update features within the
      Product, it is necessary to use certain computer system,
      hardware, and software information to implement the
      features.   By using these features, you explicitly
      authorize Microsoft or its designated agent to access
      and utilize the necessary information for Internet gaming
      and/or updating purposes.   Microsoft may use this
      information solely to improve our products or to provide
      customized services or technologies to you.  Microsoft
      may disclose this information to others, but not in a
      form that personally identifies you.    
 
    * Internet-Based Services Components.  The Product contains
      components that enable and facilitate the use of certain
      Internet-based services.  You acknowledge and agree that
      Microsoft may automatically check the version of the
      Product and/or its components that you are utilizing
      and may provide upgrades or fixes to the Product that
      will be automatically downloaded to your Workstation
      Computer. 
 
    * Security Updates.  Content providers are using the digital
      rights management technology ("Microsoft DRM") contained
      in this Product to protect the integrity of their content
      ("Secure Content") so that their intellectual property,
      including copyright, in such content is not misappropriated.  Owners of
      such Secure Content ("Secure Content Owners") may, from
      time to time, request Microsoft to provide security
      related updates to the Microsoft DRM components of the
      Product ("Security Updates") that may affect your ability
      to copy, display and/or play Secure Content through
      Microsoft software or third party applications that
      utilize Microsoft DRM.  You therefore agree that, if
      you elect to download a license from the Internet which
      enables your use of Secure Content, Microsoft may, in
      conjunction with such license, also download onto your
      computer such Security Updates that a Secure Content
      Owner has requested that Microsoft distribute.  Microsoft
      will not retrieve any personally identifiable
      information, or any other information, from your computer
      by downloading such Security Updates.
 
 8. NOT FOR RESALE SOFTWARE. Product
    identified as "Not for Resale" or "NFR," may not be resold,
    transferred or used for any purpose other than
    demonstration, test or evaluation.
 
 9. ACADEMIC EDITION SOFTWARE.  To use
    Product identified as "Academic Edition" or "AE," you must
    be a "Qualified Educational User."   For qualification-
    related questions, please contact the Microsoft Sales
    Information Center/One Microsoft Way/Redmond, WA 98052-6399

    You acknowledge that the Product is of U.S. origin and
    subject to U.S. export jurisdiction.  You agree to comply
    with all applicable international and national laws that

11. LIMITED WARRANTY FOR PRODUCT ACQUIRED IN
    THE US AND CANADA. 
 
    Microsoft warrants that the Product will perform
    substantially in accordance with the accompanying
    materials for a period of ninety days from the date of
    receipt.
 
    If an implied warranty or condition is created by
    your state/jurisdiction and federal or state/provincial law
    prohibits disclaimer of it, you also have an implied
    warranty or condition, BUT ONLY AS
    TO DEFECTS DISCOVERED DURING THE PERIOD
    OF THIS LIMITED WARRANTY (NINETY DAYS).
    AS TO ANY DEFECTS DISCOVERED AFTER THE
    NINETY (90) DAY PERIOD, THERE IS NO
    WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND.
    Some states/jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how
    long an implied warranty or condition lasts, so the above
    limitation may not apply to you.
 
    Any supplements or updates to the Product, including without
    limitation, any (if any) service packs or hot fixes
    provided to you after the expiration of the ninety day
    Limited Warranty period are not covered by any warranty or
    condition, express, implied or statutory.
 
    LIMITATION ON REMEDIES; NO CONSEQUENTIAL
    OR OTHER DAMAGES. Your exclusive remedy for any breach
    of this Limited Warranty is as set forth below.  Except
    for any refund elected by Microsoft, YOU ARE NOT ENTITLED
    TO ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT
    LIMITED TO CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, if
    the Product does not meet Microsoft's Limited Warranty,
    and, to the maximum extent allowed by applicable law, even
    if any remedy fails of its essential purpose.  The terms
    of Section 13 below ("Exclusion of Incidental,
    Consequential and Certain Other Damages")  are also
    incorporated into this Limited Warranty. Some states/
    jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation
    of incidental or consequential damages, so the above
    limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.  This
    Limited Warranty gives you specific legal rights.  You
    may have others which vary from state/jurisdiction to
    state/jurisdiction. YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY.  Microsoft's
    and its suppliers' entire liability and your exclusive
    remedy shall be, at Microsoft's option from time to time
    exercised subject to applicable law, (a) return of the
    price paid (if any) for the Product, or (b) repair or
    replacement of the Product, that does not meet this
    Limited Warranty and that is returned to Microsoft with
    a copy of your receipt. You will receive the remedy
    elected by Microsoft without charge, except that you are
    responsible for any expenses you may incur (e.g. cost of
    shipping the Product to Microsoft).  This Limited Warranty
    is void if failure of the Product has resulted from
    accident, abuse, misapplication, abnormal use or a virus.
    Any replacement Product will be warranted for the
    remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30)
    days, whichever is longer. Outside the United States or
    Canada, neither these remedies nor any product support
    services offered by Microsoft are available without proof
    of purchase from an authorized international source.  To
    exercise your remedy, contact:  Microsoft, Attn. Microsoft
    Sales Information Center/One Microsoft Way/Redmond, WA
    98052-6399, or the Microsoft subsidiary serving
    your country.
